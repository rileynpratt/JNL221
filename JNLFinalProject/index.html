<h2><center>The Untold Costs of Being Disabled in America</center></h2>

<p>What does your work or school day look like? Maybe you wake up, shower, get dressed, make breakfast, go to work or classes, drive home, go to sleep. </p>

<p>Wake up, shower, get dressed, make breakfast, go to work or classes, drive home, go to sleep.</p> 

<p>Wake up, shower, get dressed, make breakfast, go to work or classes, drive home–</p> 

<p>Get hit by an oncoming vehicle, get thrown from your car, get told you’re never going to walk again. </p>

<p>That’s what happened to Adam Sargent, and to millions of Americans like him. About twenty years ago, Adam had been an able-bodied college senior, driving to take a final exam, when his car was walloped by a truck at an intersection. He’d been thrown through the windshield, body slammed into a telephone pole. When he came to, he couldn’t feel the lower half of his body. </p>

<p>“The options went from feeling infinite to very finite very quickly,” he said. </p>

<p>Life-changing accidents like these can happen at any time–but at the same time, they’re hard to plan for. Most Americans don’t have the savings to cover surprise expenses of $1,000 or more, according to a Bankrate survey conducted in 2022. And an injury like Adam Sargent’s will be costing more than $1,000. </p>

<p>Imagine your work or school day in a wheelchair. </p>

<p>You wake up, get into your chair. A quality manual wheelchair will cost a little less than $3,000. A motorized wheelchair will cost 1-2 thousand more. </p>

<p>To shower, you need a bathroom big enough to sit in, accommodate the wheelchair, with handrails and shelves you can reach. Need to renovate your bathroom? That’ll be tens of thousands of dollars.</p>

<p>Now you have to get dressed without standing or moving your legs. </p>

<p>If your bedroom is upstairs, you’ll need an indoor chair lift to get to your kitchen, or someone who can carry you. A chair lift can cost around $4,000, and to get it installed professionally will cost a few hundred more.</p>

<p>If you can reach the cabinets, stovetop, or other appliances of your kitchen without standing up, then you can make breakfast. If you can’t, a kitchen renovation can cost anything from $5,000 to $50,000. </p>

<p>How will you get to work? If you have a wheelchair-accessible van, you can drive. Most wheelchair-accessible vans cost between $40,000 and $70,000. </p>

<p>The average balance in an American savings account is about $3,250. </p>

<p>When most Americans think about the financial burden of a severe injury, they think about the egregious medical bill, maybe the cost of therapies or rehab. However, there’s a hidden cost many don’t think about–the cost of simply navigating a world that wasn’t designed with you in mind. </p>

<p>“For three months after my injury, I was in a rehab center in Chicago,” Adam Sargent told me, “and I’m going to recognize that I was there because my family has health insurance and car insurance, and I had the opportunity, in my most vulnerable state, to go to a space that not everybody would have a chance to go to.” </p>

<p>Sargent admitted he was fortunate to come from a family and community that could support him, emotionally and financially, during this time. His mother was able to move to Chicago to be with him while he healed; his lacrosse teammates at the University of Notre Dame started a GoFundMe to raise money for a wheelchair-accessible van for him. </p>

<p>Many Americans, however, don’t have these resources. Approximately 27 million Americans (around 8.3% of the population) don’t even have health insurance, according to a report from the Census Bureau. </p>

<center><iframe title="How Many Americans Need Accessible Housing?" aria-label="Column Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-9PH9l" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/9PH9l/4/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border: none;" width="600" height="596" data-external="1"></iframe></center>

<p>One resource that the whole nation is seriously lacking is accessible housing. As the chart shows, there are 15.2 million households in America with a physical disability–but only 6.6 million American houses built to accommodate a physical disability. </p>

<p>Combine that with the fact that accessible homes are, on average, 10% more expensive than inaccessible ones, and it should come as no surprise that households with a physically disabled member are 12.4% more likely to be cost burdened than completely able-bodied households. Cost burden is when a household must spend more than 30% of its income to pay for housing. Forget the van, the wheelchair, the chair lift–housing alone takes a big chunk out of the budgets of households with a disabled member. </p>

<p>This chart takes a look at the disparity between cost-burdenship in households with and without disabilities in major metropolitan areas. Can you find a city near you?</p>

<br>
<br>
<p>With all these additional expenses, the financial strain for Americans with disabilities–beyond the cost of medical bills–seems insurmountable. This is why initiatives like Social Security Disability Insurance exist (although, you do have to meet Social Security’s <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/benefits/disability/qualify.html">strict definition of disability</a> first). It’s a fact able-bodied people have the privilege to not think about: navigating a world not built for your body is expensive, no matter what.
